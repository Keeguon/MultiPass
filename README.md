# MultiPass [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Keeguon/MultiPass.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Keeguon/MultiPass)

MultiPass is a kick-ass library to authenticate yourself against third-party APIs using the OAuth 1 or OAuth 2 authentication scheme. It is widely inspired by similar work in other language such as OmniAuth in Ruby or Passport in Node/JS.


## Dependencies

* PHP 5.3.x or newer
* Official OAuth extension (<http://pecl.php.net/oauth>)
* oauth2-php (<https://github.com/Keeguon/oauth2-php>)


## Installation

### composer

To install MultiPass with composer you simply need to create a composer.json in your project root and add:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "multipass/multipass": ">=1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then run

```bash
$ wget -nc http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
$ php composer.phar install
```

You have now MultiPass installed in vendor/multipass/multipass

And an handy autoload file to include in you project in vendor/.composer/autoload.php


## Testing

The library is fully tested with PHPUnit for unit tests. To run tests you need PHPUnit which can be installed using the project dependencies as follows:

```bash
$ php composer.phar install --dev
```

Then to run the test suites

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```
